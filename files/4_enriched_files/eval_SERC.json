SERC is a quasi-public agency established according to CGS \u00a710-357 to assist the State Board of EducaMon in the provision of programs and acMviMes that promote educaMonal equity and excellence. SERC provides professional development and informaMon disseminaMon in the latest research and best pracMces to educators, service providers, and families throughout the state.\n\nSERC is known for this high-quality, research-based professional learning support as part of its commitment to improve the achievement of ConnecMcut's children and youth. Its professional learning opportuniMes include both statewide programming acMviMes and increasingly on-site, job-embedded technical assistance in ConnecMcut public schools, programs, and districts.\n\nSERC was formed in 1969 as the Special EducaMon Resource Center and became the State EducaMon Resource Center in 2005 under a change in state statutes. Over the years, SERC has offered iniMaMves that support the achievement of all learners, with the belief that programs are most effecMve when general educaMon and special educaMon do not funcMon as separate systems, but are united. The change in name appropriately reflected the broad services and programs that SERC had been offering for many years in areas important to both general and special educaMon. The agency conMnues to maintain the Special EducaMon Resource Center in addiMon to its broader responsibiliMes, including early childhood educaMon and school improvement.\n\nAddiMonal informaMon on SERC is available in our Annual Report, which can be found at our web site h?p://www.ctserc.org under the tab 'About SERC.'\n\n- II.
